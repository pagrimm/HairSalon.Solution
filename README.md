# Eau Claire's Salon
**Weekly Independent Project for Epicodus**  
**By Peter Grimm, 07.31.2020**

## Description

Weekly independent project for Epicodus, an MVC web application to track stylists and their clients for a salon. Designed to showcase my knowledge and skills with MySQL and the Entity Framework.

## Specifications
User Stories
* As the salon owner, I need to be able to see a list of all stylists.
* As the salon owner, I need to be able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* As the salon owner, I need to add new stylists to our system when they are hired.
* As the salon owner, I need to be able to add new clients to a specific stylist. I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* .NET Core 2.2 will need to be installed, it can be found here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2
* For Mac users, download MySQL here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914
* For Windows users, download MySQL here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919
* Install MySQL and set the system path, more information on how to do that can be found here: https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql
* Run MySQL by entering `mysql -uroot -pepicodus` in the terminal
* Enter the following commands to create the necessary database and tables:
```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `peter_grimm`;
CREATE DATABASE `peter_grimm`;
USE DATABASE `peter_grimm`;
CREATE TABLE `clients` (
  `ClientId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `StylistId` int NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`ClientId`)
);
CREATE TABLE `stylists` (
  `StylistId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`StylistId`)
);
```
* Alternatively, if you are using MySQL Workbench, the database can be generated by importing `peter_grimm.sql` located in the `HairSalon.Solution` directory
* This functionality is located in MySQL Workbench's `Server` menu under `Data Import`, select `Import from Self-Contained File`, browse to select the included `peter_grimm.sql` file, and finally select `Start Import`
* Clone the GitHub repository by running `git clone https://github.com/pagrimm/HairSalon.Solution.git` in the terminal
* Navigate to the newly created `HairSalon.Solution` folder
* Navigate to the `HairSalon` subfolder and run `dotnet restore`
* Run `dotnet build` to build the app and `dotnet run` to run it
* The web app will now be available on `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser
